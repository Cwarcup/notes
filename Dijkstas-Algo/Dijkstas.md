# Dijkstra's Algorithm

- uses graphs and priority queues to search a graph. 

- **Finds the shortest path between two vertices on a graph**
- "What's the fastest way to get from point A to point B?"

#### Use cases

- GPS - finding fastest route 
- Network Routing - finds open shortest path for data 
- Biology - used to model the spread of viruses among humans 
- Airline tickets - finding cheapest route to your destination
