# OOP and FP are paradigms that allow us to organize code.

- more clear and understandable
- easy to extend - grow with you
- easier to maintain
- memory efficient
- dry - don't repeat yourself

## OOP

- bringing everything together in an object makes it easier to understand how a program works.
- ava, Objects.
- is like a robot - multiple components working together.
- Prototypes

## FP

- believes that data and behaviour are distinctly different things and should be kept separate.
- functions, Scheme
- is like a hose, takes all the data and will manipulate that to create what it wants. Filters out.
- Closures - are a big part of functions.
