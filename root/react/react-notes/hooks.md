# Hooks

Hooks are a way to write reusable code, instead of more classic techniques like inheritance.

## Hooks System
- `useState`
  - function that lets you use **state** in a functional component. 
- `useEffect`
  - function that lets you use something like **lifecycle methods** in a functional component.
- `useRef`
  - function that lets you create a **'ref'** in a functional component.

## Primitive Hooks

Are built-in react functions:

- useState
- useEffect
- useContext
- useReducer
- useCallback
- useMemo
- useRed
- useImperativeHandle
- useLayoutEffect
- useDebugValue

## Custom Hook

May reuse a few primitive hooks from react. We can create our own and should be reusable.
