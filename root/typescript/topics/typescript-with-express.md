# TypeScript with JavaScript Libraries

Three ways of using libraries with TypeScript:
- use the library normally, adding in basic type annotations where possible
- use a TypeScript adapter library that has helpers for using your library with TypeScript
  - example is [ts-express-decorators](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-express-decorators)
- Twist your library to work with TypeScript classes
