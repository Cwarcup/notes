## What is a Data Structure?

Each data structure is good for its own thing. It's simply a way of storing different types of information.

- Arrays
- Objects
- Booleans
- Queues
- Linked Lists
- Tres
- Tries
- Graphs
- Hash Tables

Algorithms

- Sorting
- Dynamic Programming
- BFS + DFS (Searching)
- Recursion

Each language has there own data types. For example, JS has numbers, string, booleans, undefined. JS uses arrays [] and objects {} to organize these data types.

## Operations on Data Structures

**Insertion** = adding a new data item to our collection into memory.
**Deletion** = deleting an item from our collection.
**Traversal** = access each item exactly once.
**Searching** = to find out the location of the data item and seeing if it exists.
**Sorting** = is ordered? How?
**Access** = how do we get this inforamtion.
